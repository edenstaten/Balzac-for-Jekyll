One of the things that terrifies me about the internet is how easily it enables state surveillance. Of the many times, i have brought up to people my fear/paranoia regarding the U.S. government’s ability to surveil citizens who don’t agree with it, they have often been dismissed. “Well, if you’re not doing anything wrong or illegal you don’t have anything to worry about,” they’ll say. Well, was Martin Luther King Jr. doing something wrong, was Fred Hampton doing anything wrong, or Frantz Fanon? Nonetheless, American intelligence agencies had whole dossiers on them, and have even gone as far to orchestrate some of their deaths. A government interested in maintaining power does not care if you are a ‘good’ or ‘bad’ person, only that you don’t oppose their interests -- and if you do -- not on a wide-enough scale to cause serious sociopolitical upheavals. 
	As an activist living in the age of the internet, this especially concerns me. Now more than ever, private companies and other entities amass huge amounts of behavioral data on people all over the world, and, as Ceglowski discusses in “Internet With a Human Face,” these massive companies have no qualms about sharing this data with the government. “All an interested government has to do is ask,” Ceglowski says, “The word 'terrorism' is an open sesame that opens any doors.” This is not to say that data collection is inherently bad, but this data is not collected in a vacuum, and we should question who is collecting it, where it’s going, and how it is being used. Data collection doesn’t give us complete power or clarity. It is, as Ceglowski asserts, “a mirror, reflecting whatever assumptions we approach it with.” So yeah, food for thought.
